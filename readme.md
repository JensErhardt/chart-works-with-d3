<h1>Chart Works with d3</h1>

<p>This was actually a practice drawing a line chart with d3 for work. But then it turned out to be fun and I decided to add more charts and features such as regression and interactivity. For further details please see the listed charts below.</p>

<p>Technoligies used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery and d3 library to visualize different data.</p>

<p>1.) Fetching data from api.coindesk.com and showing it in a line chart. Done following this <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learn-to-create-a-line-chart-using-d3-js-4f43f1ee716b">Tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>2.) Predicted BPI. Prediction done by neuronal network based on January values.</p>

<p>3.) Simple linear regression based on fetched data using price and interval.</p>

<p>4.) Copy of 1.) generating and visulizating random data using a maximum number from an input.</p>
